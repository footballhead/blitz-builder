# BlitzBuilder

A Minecraft "inspired" thing done in Blitz Basic (the Blitz3D kind).

**It's been 5 years since I've looked at the source. I've only done minor touch up so that it runs.**

## Compiling

 * Download and install Blitz3D (http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907)
 * Load Blitz3D
 * Open `MC3D.bb`
 * Click the "Run" button on the toolbar (looks like a rocket ship)

Those those of you brave enough I think `MC.ipf` should work in IDEal.

## Controls

 * WASD - Movement
 * Left click - Place current block
 * Right click - Destroy block
 * Space - jump
 * Q - Change current block type

## Video

Here's a video of it in action:

I'll put it under MIT, why not.
